## About

This is a clone of a New York Times article which I developed as part of [The Odin Project: HTML and CSS module, Project: Positioning and Floating Elements](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/html-and-css/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements). As the title suggests, the objective of this was to practice positioning and floating.

### Live Demo

[GitHub Pages](https://kath-ldn.github.io/nyt-article/).

### Built with

HTML and CSS

## Prerequisites & Installation

No special requirements.

## Roadmap

None planned.

### Known Issues

As in most projects - rather than copying exactly using Dev Tools, I try to think of the HTML/CSS myself in order to practice and learn. Therefore, this isn't a perfect replica. Since I did the first version of this I have learned a lot more about CSS - notably how to make it more modular (and therefore consise/reusable). I've also learned more about grid and flexbox, responsive design and interactivity (animations etc.). 

* Interactivity e.g. hover-effects to be added;
* Revisit responsive design, particularly
    * Text sizing on re-size;
    * Articles at bottom  which disappear on 740px;
    * Theory of inflation section under 740px;
    * Video and image sizing/positioning.
* In-text links (in main article);
* Not included the new header that appears on scroll under 1150px - this would require JS to do effectively which is out of scope of this project.
* Refine CSS to make more modular, reduce down.
