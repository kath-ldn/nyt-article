# New York Times Article Copy
ALL CONTENT IS COPYRIGHT THE NEW YORK TIMES.

Copy of NYT article in order to practice positioning with HTML/CSS. No JS used but I may add it in future.

To improve on:
- Increase responsiveness to make it match original article (https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0)
- Refine effects such as hovers, ease in & out etc.
- Add links in-text.
